"""Mutual shading and blocking between heliostats.

Why analytically rather than with Quadoa blocker geometry
---------------------------------------------------------
Both effects are pure geometric occlusion by opaque flat rectangles, so a
ray-rectangle intersection test gives the same answer as inserting blocker
surfaces would -- without rebuilding model geometry 645 x N_timesteps times.
The whole field for a whole sweep costs seconds here.

It also means shading is computed *outside* the ray trace, so the model can be
revised, re-tuned, or turned off entirely without re-tracing anything.

Definitions
-----------
**Shading**  a neighbour casts a shadow on this heliostat, so less sunlight
             arrives. Tested along the sun vector.
**Blocking** a neighbour intercepts this heliostat's reflected beam before it
             reaches the secondary. Tested along the beam to the aim point.

Both are returned as fractions in [0, 1] of the mirror aperture that remains
useful, and enter the flux calculation as scalar multipliers on that
heliostat's contribution.

Mirror orientation convention
-----------------------------
The mirror rectangle spans ``mirror_width`` along the horizontal axis
``u = normalize(z x n)`` and ``mirror_height`` along ``v = n x u``, matching the
model's ``rect s_x=2500 s_y=1500`` and the basis used by the shape solver. If
the model's local x/y were ever swapped, shading fractions would change
slightly; :func:`self_check` exercises the geometry against hand-checkable cases.
